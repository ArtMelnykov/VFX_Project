# Unity Sword Slash VFX Effect

This personal project was developed in Unity and showcases my skills in Unity animation system, Shader Graph, the particle system, and C#.

In this project, I implemented:
1. Shader Graph: visual effect shader for the slash, featuring dynamic glow, gradient transitions, and smooth deformation to convey a sense of power.
2. Particle System: effects like sparks and trailing elements that add depth and realism to the attack.
3. C# Scripting: coordinated all the components, including animation triggers, effect timing, and overall integration, to ensure everything works seamlessly together.

## Objective:
Explore Unity's tools for developing combat visual effects, improve integration with C# scripting, and demonstrate a professional approach to creating VFX.

Recommended version of Unity - 2022.3.51f1
